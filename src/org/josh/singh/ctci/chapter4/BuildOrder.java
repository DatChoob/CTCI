//You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). Ail of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.
//        EXAMPLE Input:
//        projects: a, bj c, d, e, f
//        dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
//        Output: F, e, a, b, dj c
